# Restaurant Page (made with Javascript)

This project serves as my introduction to Webpack, Npm and export-import functions, being a webpage created dynamically with Javascript using (almost) no HTML at all. The restaurant in the page is completely fictional, as well as adresses, emails and phone numbers.

While making this project i first started with the overall theme and design of the page itself, first creating the 'home' page (originally named the 'about' page, and referred to as such internally) and then moving on to the menu and finally to the contact pages. The menu was by far the most challenging page to create as i really had no idea on how to make it look good, but i do think the end result is quite nice. Also, fun fact: i originally wanted to do a pirate-themed restaurant, but there were no decent stock photos around at all! I also had to switch 'BBQ Ribs' to 'Burger + fries' in the menu page as virtually all BBQ Ribs photos on the internet are paid.

 The page itself is quite simple, but since it is my first time using webpack and assets it served as really good practice for future projects. I also wanted to create a very nice looking website, which means the CSS in this project is a bit more complex when compared to most of my previous projects, especially with the addition of assets (Images and Downloaded Fonts).
